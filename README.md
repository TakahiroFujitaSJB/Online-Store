# Currently there are list of things to keep in mind with this app:
 * data.js in src/lib is a sample json simulation.
 * Currently only the first two items has their own page for the sake of time.
 * The buy option is missing temporary while I test out shopping cart feature using Redux

## How launch locally

### 'npm install'

This should download all packages and depndancies but if not, here are some other commands:

 * npm i  -D sass

### `npm run dev`
